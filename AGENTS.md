# Zai

Personal finance desktop app built with Tauri (Rust backend + React frontend).

## Overview

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind v4 + shadcn (`apps/frontend/`)
- **Desktop**: Tauri/Rust with SQLite (`apps/tauri/`, `crates/`)
- **Web mode**: Axum HTTP server (`apps/server/`)

## General guardrails

- Keep it simple: we are not trying to impress nobody. Prefer simpler flows and
  clear UIs over complicated UX.
- Avoid unnecessary comments in code. Add a comment only to explain non-obvious
  rationale, such as difficult logic, magic numbers, or hardcoded strings.
  Treat comments as a code smell by default.
- Investigate problems to the root cause and fix them. Never cover up, ignore,
  or hide a problem just to make it disappear.
- Max 400 LOC files. Break them into multiple files when they become too big

## Agent Playbook

### Adding a feature with backend data

1. **Frontend route/UI** → `apps/frontend/src/routes/`
2. **Command wrapper** → `apps/frontend/src/commands/` or
   `features/<feature>/commands/`
3. **Tauri command** → `apps/tauri/src/commands/*.rs`, wire in `mod.rs` +
   `lib.rs`
4. **Web endpoint** → `apps/server/src/api/`, call `crates/core` service
5. **Core logic** → `crates/core/` services/repos
6. **DB** → `crates/db/` repositories, migrations in `crates/db/migrations`
7. **Tests** → Vitest for TS, `#[test]` for Rust

### UI patterns

- Components: always use `shadcn` and `@base-ui/react`
- Forms: `react-hook-form` + `zod` schemas from
  `apps/frontend/src/features/<feature>/types/`
- Theme: tokens in `apps/frontend/src/styles.css`

### Architecture pattern

```json
Frontend command wrapper → invokeCommand → Tauri IPC
                ↓
            crates/core (business logic)
                ↓
            crates/db (repository)
```

## Conventions

### TypeScript

- Strict mode, no unused locals/params
- Prefer interfaces over types, avoid enums
- Functional components, named exports
- Directory names: lowercase-with-dashes
- Never `throw/try/catch`. Use `@praha/byethrow`

### Rust

- Idiomatic Rust, small focused functions
- `Result`/`Option`, propagate with `?`, `thiserror` for domain errors
- Keep Tauri commands thin—delegate to `crates/core`
- Migrations in `crates/db/migrations`

### Security

- All data local (SQLite), no cloud
- Secrets via OS keyring—never disk/localStorage
- Never log secrets or financial data

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues, and external PRs are also a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Use the default Matt Pocock triage label vocabulary. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Use single-context domain docs. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
